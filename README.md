# README
This repo includes python 2.7 and python 3.5 code used to generate a dataset from scratch. It also includes data at various stages of development (raw, messy, clean), all found in the *data* folder. In addition, there is a *pickle_files* folder that contains, you guessed it, pickle files. All of this has been done for python 2.7 and python 3.5. You will see names ending in py27 or py35 as well as folders identifying what is what. The only item that is not included is a random forest pickle file generated using python 2.7 because it exceeds the 100 MB limit set by GitHub. 

**Random note:** without setting out to explore this, I discovered that python 3's pickling process is roughly 3-4 times more efficient (at least with my files) than python 2. Yet another reason to migrate to python 3!
